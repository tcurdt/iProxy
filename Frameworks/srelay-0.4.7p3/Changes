  + Renew autoconf and its source configure.in, etc.
acconfig.h
  - removed
configure.in
  + Added acconfig.h contents.
  + Modified LINUX related checkings.
srelay.h
get-bind.c
  + Added code for getting Linux routing table.

0.3.3 (2003/01/02)
relay.c
  + Bugfix
    Thread mode srelay consumes CPU nearly 100% on FreeBSD 4.7
    and Solaris 8. rfds/xfds in relay() could be polluted by
    something I could not make out.
init.c
main.c
util.c
relay.c
srelay.h
  + Added child process control
    Child process control for Fork mode was full of imcompleteness.

0.3.2 (2002/12/06)
  + Bugfix
    UDP associate request(which is not yet implemented;-) triggers
    service unavailable entirely.
socks.c
auth-pwd.c
srelay.h
  timerd_read()
    * Added parameter 'flags'. will be passed to recvfrom() directly.
  wait_for_read()
    * Added check FD_ISSET().
  + Added CVS Id line.

0.3.1 (2002/08/16)
main.c
  main()
    * forcing allocate the file descriptor 0/1/2 to /dev/null.

relay.c
  readn()
  writen()
  forward()
    * reduce settimer() call. saving CPU usage.

0.3 (2002/06/14)
auth-pwd.c
  auth_pwd_server()
    * log format
    * make sure to cleanup username password storage.

init.c
relay.c
  global array str_serv_sock added.
  which is used in tcp_wrapper's validation control.
  this array holds strings formed
	nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn.ppppp
  where nnn.... is IP address and ppppp is a port number.
  this corresponds srelay server's listen socket, i.e. arguments
  of 'i' option. this string can be used as "daemon list" of 
  tcp_wrappers hosts_access(5) file.
  when you started srelay

  # srelay -i 123.223.100.10

  you can put in 'hosts.allow' like,

  123.223.100.10.1080: my.domain.com 123.223.100.

  with no 'i' option,

  0.0.0.0.1080: 123.123.123.

  will be evaluated. in any case, the daemon list 'srelay' can

  be evaluated as whole daemon sockets of srelay.

relay.c
  relay()
  change some codes for collecting informations of transfer state
  logging.

main.c
socks.c
  command line '-b' option added.
  this indicates SOCKS BIND sockets port restriction off.
  the port restriction is impremented in my own way, because the
  definition of BIND requested port is quite not sure.

  RFC1928 says about BIND request's DST.PORT just, 

  ... In(It ?) is expected that a SOCKS server will use DST.ADDR
  and DST.PORT in evaluating the BIND request.

  and, NEC's draft "draft-ietf-aft-socks-pro-v5-04, 22 February 1999"
  (http://www.socks.nec.com/draft/draft-ietf-aft-socks-pro-v5-04.txt)
  rewrites here by,

  DST.ADDR must be the address of the primary connection's
  destination.  DST.PORT should be the requested port (or 0 for a
  random, unused port).  It is expected that a SOCKS server will
  use DST.ADDR and DST.PORT in evaluating the BIND request.

  there are some imprementation that setting this BIND request's 
  DST.PORT to the same value as primary CONNECTion's requested
  DST.PORT. (FFFTP 1.8 etc.)

  my own rule:
     BIND port selection priority.
     1. requested port. (assuming dest->sin_port as requested port)
     2. clients src port.
     3. free port.
     and, restriction:
     if requested port or client's src port is less than
     IPPORT_RESERVEDSTART(600), force selecting free port.

socks.c

  bug fix.
  when using username/password auth in socks5 server mode, it was
  still usable as socks4 server. this conflicts,
	- user needs username/password in socks5
    but,
	- user doesn't need any authentication in using socks4.
  fixed as if the srelay invoked using '-a' option, the socks4
  requests are shut-offed.

readconf.c
  readconf()
    make function durable in reloading config.

main.c
util.c
  define SIGHUP handler 'reload'. you can reconfigure srelay.conf
  (socks relay configuration) with "kill -HUP pid" operation.

srelay.h
  BUFSIZE 2048 -> 8192
  a little blessing speed up.
